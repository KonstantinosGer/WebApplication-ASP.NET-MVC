# WebApplication-ASP.NET-MVC

In the present project we created a website that stores and manages a bookstore's data from a given SQL database.  
The user can navigate, edit and execute queries on the database, throughout the website.  
This website was created with Visual C#, using the Model View Controller (MVC) architecture.
